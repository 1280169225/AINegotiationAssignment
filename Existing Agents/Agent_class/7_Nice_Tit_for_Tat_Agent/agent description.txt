The Nice Tit for Tat agent plays a tit for tat strategy with respect to its own utility. The agent will initially cooperate, then respond in kind to the opponent's previous action, while aming for the Nash point in the domain. After each move by the opponent, it updates its Bayesian opponent model to make sure it responds with a nice move to a concession by the opponent. If the discount factor is high, or time is running out, the agent will make quicker concessions towards its bid target.
