Gahboninho V3-
A less friendly version of V2. 
To compensate this toughness and the lack of low-utility bid variety, 
a simple variance-based opponent model was added, so 
each bid is more effective.

the opponent niceness evaluation was updated, although i still can't decide
if that was an improvement or not.

More over, V3 would suggest using the opponent's best bid if the time is almost up and the
opponent's bid was not too awful. He does not do that cautiously -
if an opponent will intentionally freeze to make the agent miscalculate the time, 
V3 might give up earlier than it should
